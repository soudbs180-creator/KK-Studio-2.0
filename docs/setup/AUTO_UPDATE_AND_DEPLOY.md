# Auto Update And Deploy

This guide keeps the repository tidy while enabling automatic updates for both the hosted app and the portable client.

## Safe file organization

Use the local organizer when root-level debug files start to pile up:

```bash
npm run organize:local
```

The script only moves obvious local artifacts into `workspace/`:

- `.codex-temp*` -> `workspace/local-artifacts/codex-temp/`
- `.codex-backups*` -> `workspace/local-artifacts/codex-backups/`
- root diagnostic patches -> `workspace/diagnostics/patches/`
- root screenshots -> `workspace/diagnostics/screenshots/`
- root typecheck dumps -> `workspace/diagnostics/typecheck/`
- nested backup files under `src/`, `docs/`, and `scripts/` -> `workspace/local-artifacts/source-backups/`

This keeps the project root focused on source, config, and deployment files.

## Hosted app auto-update

Production builds now emit `dist/app-version.json`.

The client polls that manifest in production and prompts the user to refresh when a new deployment is detected.

Default behavior:

- enabled automatically on non-local `http` or `https` hosts
- disabled on `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
- can be forced off with `VITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=false`

## Portable client self-update

### 1. Build the portable bundle

```bash
npm run package:portable
```

### 2. Publish an update archive + manifest

```bash
npm run publish:portable -- --base-url https://your-static-host.example/kk-studio/portable/stable
```

This creates:

- `release/publish/stable/KK-Studio-Portable-<version>.zip`
- `release/publish/stable/manifest.json`

Host both files on any static file service.

### 3. Enable startup self-update

Inside the portable bundle:

1. Copy `support/update-config.json.example` to `support/update-config.json`
2. Set `manifestUrl` to the hosted `manifest.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "manifestUrl": "https://your-static-host.example/kk-studio/portable/stable/manifest.json"
}
```

On startup, the portable launcher will:

- read the local `app/dist/app-version.json`
- fetch the remote manifest
- download the new archive when the version is newer
- verify SHA-256 when provided
- update the bundle before the local services start
- preserve `app/services/api/.env` and `support/update-config.json`

When the portable bundle is launched from the repository-local path `<project-root>/release/KK-Studio-Portable`, the launcher also checks whether `<project-root>/dist` and the portable support scripts are newer than the bundled copies. If they are, it syncs the portable bundle from the workspace first so stale local release files do not override the latest source build.

## Cloud auto-deploy

The repository includes an optional GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/cloud-auto-deploy.yml`.

It will:

- build the project on pushes to `main` or `master`
- run the current architecture, governance, type, spec, build, and test gates
- run the configured VPS API deploy command when `KK_VPS_DEPLOY_COMMAND` is configured
- deploy to Vercel if `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` are configured

The current hosted frontend baseline is Vercel plus the VPS `services/api/` backend.
